*       | RFI_H_OUTLIER         | 00000001 | *     | *            | If set       ,the NIR Brightness Temperatures or System Temperatures standard deviation in H polarisation has reported this snapshot as an outlier of the expected trend,which is a clear indicator of the presence of one or more RFI sources in the data
*       | RFI_V_OUTLIER         | 00000002 | *     | *            | If set       ,the NIR Brightness Temperatures or System Temperatures standard deviation in V polarisation has reported this snapshot as an outlier of the expected trend,which is a clear indicator of the presence of one or more RFI sources in the data
*       | RFI_THRESH_01         | 00000004 | *     | *            | If set       ,the snapshot from that integration time is affected by an RFI source point whose intensity exceeds the threshold 01 defined in the AUX_CNFL1P file.
*       | RFI_THRESH_02         | 00000008 | *     | *            | If set       ,the snapshot from that integration time is affected by an RFI source point whose intensity exceeds the threshold 02 defined in the AUX_CNFL1P file.
*       | RFI_THRESH_03         | 00000010 | *     | *            | If set       ,the snapshot from that integration time is affected by an RFI source point whose intensity exceeds the threshold 03 defined in the AUX_CNFL1P file.
*       | RFI_THRESH_04         | 00000020 | *     | *            | If set       ,the snapshot from that integration time is affected by an RFI source point whose intensity exceeds the threshold 04 defined in the AUX_CNFL1P file.
