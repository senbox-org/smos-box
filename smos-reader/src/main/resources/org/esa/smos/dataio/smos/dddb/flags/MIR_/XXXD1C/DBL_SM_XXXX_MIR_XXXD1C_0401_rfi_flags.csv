  *       | RFI-X-Pol-NIR-Tsys      | 00000001 | *     | *            | Analysis of the NIR Brightness Temperatures or System Temperatures standard deviation in H polarisation has reported this snapshot as an outlier of the expected trend, which is a clear indicator of the presence of one or more RFI sources in the data; that the Temperatures were saturated or in the vicinity of such saturation and there is a high probability that the measurement is affected
  *       | RFI-Y-Pol-NIR-Tsys      | 00000002 | *     | *            | Analysis of the NIR Brightness Temperatures or System Temperatures standard deviation in V polarisation has reported this snapshot as an outlier of the expected trend, which is a clear indicator of the presence of one or more RFI sources in the data; that the Temperatures were saturated or in the vicinity of such saturation and there is a high probability that the measurement is affected
  *       | Low-RFI-Contamination   | 00000004 | *     | *            | The snapshot from that integration time is affected by an RFI source point whose intensity exceeds the threshold 01 defined in the AUX_CNFL1P file
  *       | Medium-RFI-Contamination | 00000008 | *     | *            | The snapshot from that integration time is affected by an RFI source point whose intensity exceeds the threshold 02 defined in the AUX_CNFL1P file
  *       | High-RFI-Contamination  | 00000010 | *     | *            | The snapshot from that integration time is affected by an RFI source point whose intensity exceeds the threshold 03 defined in the AUX_CNFL1P file
