<h3>SMOS-Box</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The SNAP SMOS-Box project has been brought into life in order
    to support users of data acquired by ESA's Soil Moisture and
    Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. SNAP and the SMOS-Box are user
    tools which ESA/ESRIN are providing free of charge to the Earth
    Observation Community.</p>

<p>The SMOS-Box software has been developed by <a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/">Brockmann Consult</a> under
    ESA contract initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC) and coordinated
    by Peter Regner (ESRIN).</p>

<p>This document set provides the online help for Version 5.4.0 of the SMOS-Box.</p>

<h4>License</h4>

<h4>Supported Data Products</h4>

<p>Version 5.4.0 of the SNAP SMOS-Box is capable of reading SMOS
    data products complying with Schemas Release
    2016-08-30_v07-03-00 and earlier. The product types supported are listed in
    the table below.</p>

<h4>Tools and commands</h4>

<p>Version 5.3.0 of the SMOS-Box includes six SMOS-specific tools
    and commands:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="Tools.html#gridPointTable">Grid point data
        table</a>: all measurements made for the grid point selected by
        either the mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a
        table.
    </li>

    <li><a href="Tools.html#gridPointFlagMatrix">Grid point flag
        matrix diagram</a>: all flags associated with the measurements
        made for the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer or
        a selected pin are displayed in a flag matrix
    </li>

    <li><a href="Tools.html#gridPointChart">Grid point brightness
        temperature chart</a>: All brightness temperatures measured for
        the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer or a
        selected pin are displayed in a chart
    </li>

    <li><a href="Tools.html#snapshotInformationTool">Snapshot
        information tool</a>: information for all snapshots contained
        in a Level-1c Science product can be browsed with a slider
    </li>

    <li><a href="GridPointExport.html">Grid point export
        command</a>: exports all data for a user-defined set of SMOS
        grid points into a plain text file
    </li>

    <li><a href="NetcdfExport.html">NetCDF conversion
        command</a>: convert SMOS file(s) in Earth Explorer format to
        NetCDF-4
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>File Format Updates</h4>

<p>A new feature in SMOS-Box 5.4.0 allows users to implement file format updates independent from new software releases.
    Details on this feature are described in the chapter <a href="FileFormatUpdates.html">File Format Updates</a></p>

<h4>Known Limitations</h4>

<p>Version 5.4.0 of the SMOS-Box has the following known
    limitations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All SMOS data products are represented as global products
        covering the whole surface of the Earth. Therefore SMOS
        products do not have a geographical boundary
    </li>

    <li>Due to the representation of SMOS products as global
        products, it is not possible to draw lines or shapes crossing
        the anti-meridian
    </li>

    <li>Statistics, scatter plots, histograms and profile plots use
        image pixel data rather than SMOS grid point data
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Further Information</h4>

<p>The most important source of information for SNAP and the
    SMOS-Box is the <a href="http://forum.step.esa.int/">SNAP/STEP forum
        Forum</a>.</p>

<h4>Reporting Issues</h4>

<p>You can submit SNAP bug reports or feature request to the
    <a href="http://step.esa.int/main/community/issue-reporting/">SNAP/STEP
        Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
