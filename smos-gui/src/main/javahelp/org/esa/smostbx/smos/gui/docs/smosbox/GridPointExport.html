<h3>SMOS Grid Point Export</h3>

<p>The Grid Point Export Command can be used to export the data of
    selected DGG grid points. The data can be exported either as CSV
    formatted text file (where individual values are separated by
    a semicolon) or as Earth Explorer formatted subsets.</p>

<h4>Grid Point Export in SNAP</h4>

<p><img src="images/GridPointExport.png" alt=
        "Grid Point Export"/></p>

<p><b>Source Products:</b> Either the SMOS product selected in
    SNAP, or all SMOS products residing in a directory of the file
    system can be used for exporting. The search for SMOS products
    may optionally include subdirectories.</p>

<p><b>Region of Interest:</b> There are three possibilities for
    specifying a region of interest (ROI) considered for export:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A ROI defined by a geometry</li>

    <li>A ROI defined by the grid points under the pins of the SMOS
        product selected in SNAP
    </li>

    <li>A ROI defined by a latitude-longitude box</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Target File:</b> The file, which receives the exported data.
    For exporting as CSV, the target file must be a normal file while
    for creating Earth Explorer subsets, it must be a directory. The
    amount of data can be huge, depending on the ROI selected and the
    number of source products traversed.</p>

<p>The file name of each Earth Explorer subset is generated from
    the file name of its source, with sensing start and stop times
    matching the actual snapshots in the subset, if the source
    contains the necessary snapshot information.
</p>

<h4>Grid Point Export on the Command Line</h4>

<p>The command line tool for exporting grid point data resides in
    the <code>bin</code> directory of your SNAP installation.
    Depending on your system platform, type</p>
  <pre>
    ${S3TBX_HOME}/bin/smos-gp-export.bat
  
</pre>
  <pre>
    ${S3TBX_HOME}/bin/smos-gp-export.sh
  
</pre>

<p>or</p>
  <pre>
    ${S3TBX_HOME}/bin/smos-gp-export.command
  
</pre>

<p>in order to obtain a usage message. The grid points, for which
    data is exported can be defined by either a latitude-longitude
    box or a latitude-longitude point. For instance, type</p>
  <pre>
    smos-gp-export.sh -point 1.0 7.0 SM_TEST_MIR_SCLF1C_20070223T061043_20070223T061105_310_001_0
  
</pre>

<p>for exporting the data of a single grid point. Type</p>
  <pre>
    smos-gp-export.sh -box -10.0 10.0 -20.0 20.0 SM_TEST_MIR_SCLF1C_20070223T061043_20070223T061105_310_001_0
  
</pre>

<p>for exporting all grid points contained in a
    latitude-longitude box. The target file can defined by means of
    the <code>-o</code> option. If a target file is not defined, the
    output is printed to the console. For example, type</p>
  <pre>
    smos-gp-export.sh -point 1.0 7.0 -o export.csv SM_TEST_MIR_SCLF1C_20070223T061043_20070223T061105_310_001_0
  
</pre>

<p>If the target file is a directory, the grid point data are
    exported in form of EE formatted files, which all reside in
    the target directory. The file name of each subset product is
    generated from the file name of its source product. For example,
    type</p>
  <pre>
    smos-gp-export.sh -point 1.0 7.0 -o exportDir SM_????_MIR_SCLD1C_2010*
  
</pre>

<p>Using more than a single SMOS product as source is possible.
    The usual shell completion can be used to specify multiple
    product files. For example, type</p>
  <pre>
    smos-gp-export.sh -point 1.0 7.0 -o export.csv SM_????_MIR_SCLD1C_2010*

</pre>

<p>or</p>
  <pre>
    smos-gp-export.sh -point 1.0 7.0 -o exportDir SM_????_MIR_SCLD1C_2010*

</pre>

<p>to export only SMOS land dual-polarisation science products
    for 2010.</p>
