  <h3>SMOS-Box Tools</h3>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>Readers not familiar with the SMOS-Box software might read the
  <a href="Introduction.html">Introduction to the SMOS-Box</a> and
  the explanation of the representation of <a href=
  "DataModel.html">SMOS Data in SNAP</a> first.</p>

  <h4>Usage</h4>

  <p>Version 5.4.0 of the SMOS-Box is comprised of four tools:
  <img src="images/SmosGridPoint16.png" alt=
  "Grid point data table icon" /> the grid point data table,
  <img src="images/SmosFlags16.png" alt=
  "Grid point flag matrix icon" /> the grid point flag matrix
  diagram, <img src="images/SmosBtGraph16.png" alt=
  "Brightness temperature chart icon" /> the grid point brightness
  temperature chart, and <img src="images/SmosSnapshot16.png" alt=
  "Snapshot information tool icon" /> the snapshot information
  tool. The tools can be invoked by clicking on the corresponding
  icons arranged in the SMOS-Box toolbar shown below.</p>

  <p><img src="images/Toolbar.png" alt="SMOS Toolbar" /></p>

  <p>By default the SMOS-Box toolbar is located next to the
  standard SNAP toolbar.</p>

  <h5>Opening a SMOS product and displaying image data</h5>

  <p>When a SMOS product is opened in SNAP, the list of available
  band data is displayed in the <strong>Products View</strong>.
  Double-clicking onto a band name opens a window displaying the
  band data as an image (see the screenshots below). Due to the
  SNAP data model used internally to represent all EO data
  products, it is required to resample SMOS L1C and L2 gridded data
  to rectangular raster data. The images created from SMOS products
  in SNAP thus use the Geographic WGS-84 coordinate reference
  system.</p>

  <p>The geo-coding of all SMOS data products is provided by the
  same WGS-84 geographic coordinate reference system. The mapping
  between image pixels and SMOS grid points is established by a
  lookup table being a raster dataset of 16384 by 8192 image
  pixels, yielding about 30 image pixels for an equatorial grid
  cell of the ISEA4H-R9 grid.</p>

  <p>For SMOS L1c Science products the image displayed by default
  when double-clicking on a band is computed on-the-fly. Actually,
  the image is computed from the snapshot data in the same manner
  as a Browse product is computed from the corresponding Science
  product.</p>

  <h5><a name="gridPointTable" id="gridPointTable"><img src=
  "images/SmosGridPoint16.png" alt="Grid point data table icon" />
  Using the grid point data table</a></h5>

  <p>The grid point data table tool can be invoked by clicking on
  the <img src="images/SmosGridPoint16.png" alt=
  "Grid point data table icon" /> icon in the SMOS-Box toolbar. The
  table shows all measurements made for the currently selected grid
  point, with a single measurement record per row. By default the
  selected grid point is defined by the position of the mouse
  pointer. By activating the <strong>Snap to selected pin</strong>
  option the selected grid point may also be defined by the
  position of a currently selected pin.</p>

  <p>The measurements displayed in the table columns can be
  explicitly chosen by clicking on the <strong>Columns...</strong>
  button, which pops up a dialog for selecting or deselecting
  individual measurements. The whole table can be exported to
  character-separated text, either stored in a file or the
  clipboard.</p>

  "Grid point data table" /></p>

  <h5><a name="gridPointFlagMatrix" id=
  "gridPointFlagMatrix"><img src="images/SmosFlags16.png" alt=
  "Grid point flag matrix icon" /> Using the grid point flag
  matrix</a></h5>

  <p>The grid point flag matrix tool can be invoked by clicking on
  the <img src="images/SmosFlags16.png" alt=
  "Grid point flag matrix icon" /> icon in the SMOS-Box toolbar.
  The flag matrix shows all flags associated with measurement
  records acquired for the currently selected grid point, with a
  single measurement record per column and a single flag per row. A
  raised flag is indicated by a coloured entry in the flag matrix.
  By default the selected grid point is defined by the position of
  the mouse pointer. By activating the <strong>Snap to selected
  pin</strong> option the selected grid point may also be defined
  by the position of a currently selected pin.</p>

  "Grid point flag matrix" /></p>

  <h5><a name="gridPointChart" id="gridPointChart"><img src=
  "images/SmosBtGraph16.png" alt=
  "Brightness temperature chart icon" /> Using the grid point
  brightness temperature chart</a></h5>

  <p>The grid point brightness temperature chart tool can be
  invoked by clicking on the <img src="images/SmosBtGraph16.png"
  alt="Brightness temperature chart icon" /> icon in the SMOS-Box
  toolbar. The brightness temperature chart shows a diagram of the
  brightness temperatures measured for the currently selected grid
  point. A single series of brightness temperatures versus
  incidence angle is shown for each polarisation mode. By default
  the selected grid point is defined by the position of the mouse
  pointer. By activating the <strong>Snap to selected pin</strong>
  option the selected grid point may also be defined by the
  position of a currently selected pin.</p>

  <p>For the brightness temperature measurements made in the X and
  Y copolarisation modes the uncertainties are shown as error bars.
  The display of individual polarisation modes can be switched on
  and off by activating or deactivating the corresponding
  checkboxes.</p>

  <h5><a name="snapshotInformationTool" id=
  "snapshotInformationTool"><img src="images/SmosSnapshot16.png"
  alt="Snapshot information tool icon" /> Using the snapshot
  information tool</a></h5>

  <p>The snapshot information tool can be invoked by clicking on
  the <img src="images/SmosSnapshot16.png" alt=
  "Brightness temperature chart icon" /> icon in the SMOS-Box
  toolbar. The tool can be used for browsing the 'Swath Snapshot
  List' contained in the SMOS L1c Science products, and for selecting and displaying
  images of individual snapshots. The components of the snapshot information tool are
  described below.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: If the snapshot information tool
    is used for selecting and displaying snapshot images, all image analysis and statistics tools always apply to the
    selected snapshots.</strong></p>

  <h6>Spinner component</h6>

  <p>For selecting an individual snapshot the tool provides a
  spinner which allows to manually specify a certain snapshot ID
  and to navigate forward and backward in the list of snapshot
  IDs.</p>

  <h6>Slider component</h6>

  <p>The slider provides an explicit mechanism for fast navigation
  through the list of snapshot IDs.</p>

  <h6>Combobox component</h6>

  <p>The combobox provides a facility for selecting a certain
  polarisation mode (any, X, Y, XY). When a certain mode is
  selected, only IDs of snapshots acquired at the selected mode are
  navigable (i.e. IDs of snapshots acquired at a different mode do
  not appear in the list of snapshot IDs) by the spinner and slider
  components.</p>

  <h6>Table component</h6>

  <p>While navigating through the snapshots, the corresponding
  'Snapshot Information' like TEC and geomagnetic field, etc. are
  displayed in a table.</p>

  <h6>Synchronise checkbox</h6>

  <p>Enabled only when there is an active image view. Synchronising
  implies:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The combobox component is disabled while its value is set
    to the polarisation mode of the band displayed in the active
    image view.</li>

    <li>Only IDs of snapshots acquired at the selected polarisation
    mode are navigable.</li>

    <li>The 'radio buttons' (see below) are enabled.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Changing the active image view while being in synchronised mode
  implies:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The value of the combobox is set to the polarisation mode,
    which corresponds to the active view.</li>

    <li>The selected snapshot is preserved, unless the active image
    view corresponds to a polarisation mode, which is not available
    for the selected snapshot. In the latter case, the nearest
    snapshot acquired in the proper polarisation mode becomes
    selected.</li>
  </ol>

  <h6>Radio buttons</h6>

  <p>There are two radio buttons for selection the data source for
  the active image view. Selecting the 'Snapshot' radio button
  implies that, firstly, the active image view displays the data of
  the selected snapshot instead of the browse, and, secondly, the
  selected snapshot becomes the data source for all bands in the
  selected product, unless the proper polarisation mode is not
  available for the selected snapshot. In the latter case, the
  nearest snapshot acquired in the proper polarisation mode becomes
  the data source.</p>

  <p>Selecting the 'Browse' radio button implies that, firstly, the
  active image view shows the raster data of the browse instead of
  the selected snapshot, and, secondly, the data source for all
  bands in the selected product is reset to the browse.</p>

  <h6>Follow checkbox</h6>

  <p>When checked the viewport of the active image view
  automatically moves to and zooms into the region covered by the
  selected snapshot.</p>

  <h6>Locate button</h6>

  <p>When pressed the viewport of the active image view moves to
  and zooms into the region covered by the selected snapshot.</p>
