<h3>About the SMOS-Box Version ${project.version}</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The SMOS-Box project has been brought into life in order
    to support users of data acquired by ESA's Soil Moisture and
    Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. SNAP and the SMOS-Box are user
    tools which ESA/ESRIN are providing free of charge to the Earth
    Observation Community.</p>

<p>The SMOS-Box software has been developed by <a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/">Brockmann Consult</a> under
    ESA contract initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC, ESRIN) and coordinated
    Peter Regner (ESRIN).</p>

<h4>License</h4>

<h4>Tools and commands</h4>

<p>Version ${project.version} of the SMOS-Box includes five SMOS-specific tools
    and commands:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Grid point data table: all measurements made for the grid
        point selected by either the mouse pointer or a selected pin
        are displayed in a table.
    </li>

    <li>Grid point flag matrix diagram: all flags associated with
        the measurements made for the grid point selected by either the
        mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a flag
        matrix
    </li>

    <li>Grid point brightness temperature chart: All brightness
        temperatures measured for the grid point selected by either the
        mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a chart
    </li>

    <li>Snapshot information tool: information for all snapshots
        contained in a Level-1c Science product can be browsed with a
        slider
    </li>

    <li>Grid point export facility: exports all data for a
        user-defined set of SMOS grid points into a plain text
        file
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Known Limitations</h4>

<p>Version ${project.version} of the SMOS-Box has the following known
    limitations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All SMOS data products are represented as global products
        covering the whole surface of the Earth. Therefore SMOS
        products do not have a geographical boundary
    </li>

    <li>Due to the representation of SMOS products as global
        products, it is not possible to draw lines or shapes crossing
        the anti-meridian
    </li>

    <li>Statistics, scatter plots, histograms and profile plots use
        image pixel data rather than SMOS grid point data
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Further Information</h4>

<p>The most important source of information for SNAP and the
    SMOS-Box are the <a href="http://forum.step.esa.int/c/smos">SNAP
        Forum</a> and the <a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam-wiki/display/SBOX/">SMOS-Box Wiki</a>.</p>

<h4>Reporting Issues</h4>

<p>You can submit SNAP bug reports or feature request in the SMOS category of the <a href="http://forum.step.esa.int/c/smos">SNAP Forum</a>.</p>
